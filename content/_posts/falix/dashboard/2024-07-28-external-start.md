## How to start a server using external start.

1. Go to https://falixnodes.net/start.

2. Scroll down to "Start server".

3. Enter the server domain / IP (name.falixsrv.me).

{: .info}
> If the server IP you got ends with :00000, then you can just delete that part
> (so name.falixsrv.me:12345 becomes name.falixsrv.me).

4. Complete the captcha.

5. Press "Watch ad to start" or "start server".

6. Watch the ad until the end (if one pops up).

7. You should come to a login page (or the client home page if you have an account) with a popup saying:
{: .success}
> Server name.falixsrv.me has been started.

8. Wait a few minutes until the server has started.

{: .success}
> Your first external server has been started.
