## Introduction

Adding a resource pack to your Minecraft server can greatly enrich player experience, maintain server aesthetics, and unlock unique gameplay features not available in vanilla Minecraft. This guide will demonstrate how to require a resource pack for joining your server.

## Acquiring the Resource packs

- [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/ "A community-driven platform where users share various Minecraft content, including resource packs")
- [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/ "Known for hosting mods and addons for games, including Minecraft. It features a wide range of resource packs for Java Edition.")
- [Minecraft Forum](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs "A longstanding community forum where players discuss and share Minecraft-related content, including resource packs.")
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepacks "Modrinth is a platform tailored for Minecraft players and mod developers, offering a curated selection of mods, texture packs, and community content.")

You can also upload your own custom resource pack as well.

> **Compatibility Issues**: Ensure the resource pack is compatible with the version of Minecraft Java Edition and/or any server plugins or mods installed. Incompatible packs may cause crashes or visual glitches.

## Merging Resource Packs

Merging resource packs in Minecraft lets you combine the textures, sounds, and models from different packs into one. This way, you can customize the game to your liking, mixing your favorite elements to create a unique experience. 
By following the steps given below, you can easily merge resource packs and enjoy a more personalized Minecraft world.
