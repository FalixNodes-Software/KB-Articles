# Store
Looking to upgrade your server's resources for free? We've got you covered! You must first gain coins by following our [earning coins guide](https://falixnodes.net/help/falix/general/earning-coins), then you may purchase plans from the store by following the guide below:

## How to Access the Store
1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).
2. Hover over "...Coins", then navigate to the [Store](https://client.falixnodes.net/coins/store) page.

## How to Use the Store
After being redirected to the store page, you will be presented with the price of the plans, the resources they offer and two purchase buttons. After choosing a plan, you may either purchase for a month, or a year. Once you have purchased the plan, you should see your coins deducted, and your plan should be updated.

{: .note }
> - Plans are not a one-time purchase; you will have to pay every month.
> - Plans do not stack; it is not possible to have two plans at the same time.

## Cancelling a Plan
After being redirected to the store page, you will see the active plan's auto-renew date and a cancel button. To cancel your current plan, click "Cancel Plan".

{: .note }
> You won't be refunded after cancelling the plan.
