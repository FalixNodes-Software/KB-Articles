# A Guide to Using Databases
## What Are Databases?
A database is an organised collection of information. 
The database our panel supports is [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org).
MariaDB is a very popular open-source database that was developed by the original MySQL developers.

## What Are Databases Useful For? 
Some server plugins, bots, or software may require a database to store information. Minecraft plugins will usually state whether they need or support an SQL database.

## Creating a Database
1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).
2. Scroll down and locate your server, then click on "Play".
3. On the top navbar, hover over "Advanced Features", then navigate to "Databases".
4. Scroll down, then click on "New Database".
