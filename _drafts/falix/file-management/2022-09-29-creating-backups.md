# A Guide to Creating Backups
Backing up your server is a crucial task for every server owner. If anything bad happens to your server, such as griefing and/or unintentional actions, you'll be able to revert those changes. 
In this article, we'll give you a quick and easy explanation on how to create backups for your server within the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).
2. Scroll down and locate your server, then click on "Play".
3. On the top navbar, hover over "Advanced Features", then navigate to "Backups".
4. Scroll down, then click on "New Backup".
5. A popup should appear. Insert a descriptive name in the given field.
6. Click on "Create".
