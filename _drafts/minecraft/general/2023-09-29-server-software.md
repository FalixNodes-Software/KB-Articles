# Server Software
Selecting a server software is a crucial step in creating a server. This article will help you choose the software that fits your server's needs.

## Official Software:
### Vanilla
[Vanilla](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server) is the default software provided by Minecraft. It does not contain any modifications, nor does it support plugins or mods. We don't recommend using this software, as there are better alternatives.

### Snapshot
Snapshots are a testing version of Minecraft released by Mojang. They contain new features and additions to the game. They are released to the public in order for players to try out the new features and test if they function as intended. We don't advise using this software, as it may contain bugs or game-breaking changes.

## Plugins:
### Spigot
[Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) is a modified version of Bukkit with hundreds of improvements and optimizations. We don't recommend using this software as there are many better alternatives, such as Paper and Purpur.

### PaperMC
[PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) is an optimised fork of Spigot that aims to provide stability, configuration, and performance. We recommend using this software, as it contains many configuration options and fixes many bugs and exploits. In addition, it provides support for Spigot and Bukkit plugins and even has its own plugin API!

### Purpur
[Purpur](https://purpurmc.org/) is an optimised fork of Paper. It's much more optimized, has more configuration options, and has more features than Paper. In addition, it provides support for Spigot, Bukkit, and Paper plugins. We recommend using this server software.

### Bukkit
[Bukkit](https://getbukkit.org/) is a lightly modified version of the Vanilla software, allowing it to run Bukkit plugins. We don't recommend using this software, as there are many better alternatives, such as Paper and Purpur.

### Sponge
[Sponge](https://spongepowered.org/) is an open-source server software which has 2 versions. The vanilla version allows you to use plugins designed for Sponge only. The Forge version allows you to use both Sponge plugins and Forge mods.

## Proxies:
### BungeeCord
[BungeeCord](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/bungeecord/) is a useful software developed by the SpigotMC team. It acts as a proxy between the player's client and the connected Minecraft servers, allowing them to hop between multiple servers with ease.

### WaterFall
[WaterFall](https://github.com/PaperMC/Waterfall) is a high-performance fork of BungeeCord that aims to be more stable and to include more features.

### Velocity
[Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) is a highly optimised server software designed for scalability, flexibility, and security. It connects multiple servers so that they appear as one.

## Mods:
### Forge
[Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge) is a Minecraft software that allows players to use Forge mods and modpacks.

### Fabric
[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) is a lightweight Minecraft software used for Fabric mods. We recommend using this software in addition to a few optimization mods for the best vanilla experience.

## Both Plugins and Mods:
### Mohist
[Mohist](https://mohistmc.com/) is a hybrid server software that allows you to run Bukkit, Spigot, and Paper plugins alongside Forge mods.

### Magma
[Magma](https://magmafoundation.org/) is optimised hybrid server software. It is based on Forge and Paper, meaning it can run Bukkit, Spigot, and Paper plugins in addition to Forge mods.

### Catserver
[Catserver](https://catmc.org/) is an optimised hybrid server software. It contains many bug fixes, and it provides its own API. It allows Bukkit and Spigot plugins to function alongside Forge mods.

### Arclight
[Arclight](https://github.com/IzzelAliz/Arclight) is a hybrid server software that allows you to run Bukkit and Spigot plugins alongside Forge mods.
