|    accepts-transfers   |         Boolean        |        false       | This setting is often used in server networks where players are transferred between servers, such as in mini-game networks or large server clusters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|      allow-flight      |         Boolean        |        false       | Means that users will not be kicked if they fly whilst in Survival mode. This is likely to occur through hacking however there can be false positives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|      allow-nether      |         Boolean        |        true        | Setting allow-nether to true allows players to build Nether portals and travel to the Nether dimension. If set to false, any existing Nether portals will not function, and players will be unable to access the Nether.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|       difficulty       |         String         |        easy        | Defines the difficulty of the server.<br>- If set to `peaceful`, No hostile mobs will spawn and health regenerate quickly.<br>- If set to `easy`, Hostile mobs will spawn but they deal less damage. hunger depletes slowly.<br>- If set to `normal`, Standard difficulty with mobs dealing normal damage and hunger depletion.<br>- If set to `hard`, Hostile mobs deals more damage, hunger depletes faster, zombie breaks down doors and some game mechanics are little more challenging. |
|  enable-command-block  |         Boolean        |        false       | Controls whether command blocks can be used on the server                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|      enable-status     |         Boolean        |        true        | Enables the server to respond to status queries from external applications. This is typically desired if you want players and administrators to be able to see server information outside of the Minecraft client, such as through server lists or monitoring tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| enforce-secure-profile |         Boolean        |        true        | If set to `true`, requires players to authenticate with a verified Minecraft account before they can join the server. This helps protect against unauthorized access and enhances the overall security of the server environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|    enforce-whitelist   |         Boolean        |        false       | Setting this to `true` ensures that only players added to the whitelist can join the server. This is particularly useful for private servers or servers where access control is important, such as community servers with specific membership criteria.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|     force-gamemode     |         Boolean        |        false       | Setting this to `true` ensures that all players joining the server are immediately switched to the game mode specified by `gamemode` in server.properties. This can help enforce server rules or create consistent gameplay experiences, especially in controlled environments like minigames or events.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|        gamemode        |         String         |      survival      | Defines the mode of gameplay.<br>- If set to `survival`, Players must gather resources, build structures, and survive against hostile mobs.<br>- If set to `creative`, Players have unlimited access to the resources, They can fly, hostile mobs do not attack them.<br>- If set to `adventure`, Players can interact with objects like levers and buttons, but they are unable to break the blocks.                                                                                        |
|   generate-structures  |         Boolean        |        true        | Defines whether structures (such as villages) will be generated. <br>- If set to `true` structures generate in new chunks.<br>- If set to `false` structures are not generated in new chunks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|        hardcore        |         Boolean        |        false       | If set to true, server difficulty is ignored and set to `hard` and if the player dies, they would only able to spectate the world or exit the server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Leave blank to default to random.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|       level-type       |         String         |  minecraft:normal  | Defines the type of the world generator. (Allowed values: "normal", "flat", "large_biomes", "amplified", "single_biome_surface", "buffet", "default_1_1", "customized")                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
