## Introduction

A Minecraft server's Message of the Day (MOTD) is the brief description that appears below the server name in the multiplayer server list. It can be customized with colors and formatting to provide information or attract players' attention. The MOTD sets the tone for your server and gives players a quick idea of what to expect.

## How to add MOTD to your Minecraft Server

1. Log in to Falixnodes client panel.

2. Head over to the server console site.

3. Head over to [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/).

4. Find and Open `server.properties' file.

5. Find the `motd=`attribute and add your desired MOTD as its value and save it.
    > You may customize the MOTD with colors and formatting by using [mctools.org](https://mctools.org/motd-creator)

6. (re)Start your server.
