## Introduction

A Minecraft server's Message of the Day (MOTD) is the brief description that appears below the server name in the multiplayer server list. It can be customized with colors and formatting to provide information or attract players' attention. The MOTD sets the tone for your server and gives players a quick idea of what to expect.

## How to add a MOTD to your Minecraft Server

### Step 1: Locating the server.properties file

- Navigate to Falix's [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/).
- Open the `server.properties' file.

### Step 2: Editing server.properties file

- Locate the line starting with `motd=`
- Customize your MOTD by adding your message after `motd=`. Use [mctools.org](https://mctools.org/motd-creator) for colors and formatting.
- Save the file.

### Step 3: Start or restart your server

- Refresh the server list in-game to ensure the MOTD is displayed correctly.
