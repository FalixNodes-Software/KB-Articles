## Introduction

Adding a resource pack to your Minecraft server can greatly enrich player experience, maintain server aesthetics, and unlock unique gameplay features not available in vanilla Minecraft. This guide will demonstrate how to require a resource pack for joining your server.

## Acquiring the Resource packs

- [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/ "A community-driven platform where users share various Minecraft content, including resource packs")
- [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/ "Known for hosting mods and addons for games, including Minecraft. It features a wide range of resource packs for Java Edition.")
- [Minecraft Forum](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/resource-packs "A longstanding community forum where players discuss and share Minecraft-related content, including resource packs.")
- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/resourcepacks "Modrinth is a platform tailored for Minecraft players and mod developers, offering a curated selection of mods, texture packs, and community content.")

You can also upload your own custom resource pack as well.

> **Compatibility Issues**: Ensure the resource pack is compatible with the version of Minecraft Java Edition and any server plugins or mods installed. Incompatible packs may cause crashes or visual glitches.

## Adding a Resource Pack to the server

1. Upload the resource pack to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home) or a similar filesharing service.

2. Copy the direct download link.

4. Go to the [File Manager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/) in the Client Panel.

5. Find the `server.properties` file and open it.

6. Within the file, find the line starting with `resource-pack=` and paste the previously copied link after it.

7. Save the file

8. Start or restart the server
