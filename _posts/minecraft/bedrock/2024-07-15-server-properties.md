## Introduction

The `server.properties` file for a Bedrock Edition Minecraft server is a configuration file used to set various options and parameters for the server. This file allows server administrators to customize the server's behavior, such as setting the game mode, maximum player limit, difficulty level, server name, and more. By editing the server.properties file, you can control key aspects of the gameplay experience for all players on your Bedrock server.
