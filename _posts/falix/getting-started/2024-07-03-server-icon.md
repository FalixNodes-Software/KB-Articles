1. Find or create a PNG image you wish to use as your server icon. Transparency is supported.

2. Resize it to 64 by 64 pixels and rename it to `server-icon.png`, or use an online tool, such as [Casper's Server Icon Maker](https://casperslab.me/falix/server-icon-maker/).

3. On Falix, go to `Manage` > `File Manager` and upload the server icon file.

4. Restart your server to apply the changes.
