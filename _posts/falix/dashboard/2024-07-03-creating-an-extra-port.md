1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Scroll down and locate your server, then click on `Play`.

3. In the top navigation bar, click on `Advanced` > `Network`.

4. Click `New Port` button.

5. One random port will be allocated to your server that will be used for any plugins or mods that require extra ports access.

6. Something like this will be displayed:

    | Hostname            | IP        | Port  | Primary      |
    | ------------------- | --------- | ----- | ------------ |
    | xxx.falixserver.net | 127.0.0.1 | 12345 | Primary Port |
    | xxx.falixserver.net | 127.0.0.1 | 12346 |              |
