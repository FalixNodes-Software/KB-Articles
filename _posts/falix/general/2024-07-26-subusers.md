# Information about subusers

{: .info}
> You do not need to add Subusers to let other people start your server.
> To let users (and even non-users) start your server please let them use [the external start page](https://falixnodes.net/start)
> or refer to our [External start guide](https://example.com).

## What are Subusers?

Subusers are the way to share your server with other FalixNodes users to collaborate together on your game server or let them offer support. It allows you to share access to your server with other people without giving them full control over your main account and servers.
