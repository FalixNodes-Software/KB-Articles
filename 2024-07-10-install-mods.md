## Using the Mods Installer

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Scroll down and locate your server, then click on "Play".

3. You will be redirected to your server's [Console](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console) page. In the top navigation bar, hover over "Manage", then navigate to [mods](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/mods).

4. Type the name of your Mod of choice in the "Search Mods" field, then click on "Search".

5. Locate your Mod within the search results, then click on "Install".

6. Navigate back to the [Console](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/console). Scroll down and on the bottom right of the console, click on the green "Start" button.

## Using the File Manager or SFTP

1. Log in to the [Dashboard](https://client.falixnodes.net/).

2. Scroll down and locate your server, then click on "Play".

3. Download the Mod of choice using the search engine of your choice or from your favorite mod repository like:
    - [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/search)
    - [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods)

{: .warning}

> Before downloading, take a look at:
> - the Minecraft version of the mod
> - the modloader needed (any forge Mod will work on neoforge servers)
> and make sure those are the same as your server

4. Navigate to the [FileManager](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/) by hovering over "Manage" and clicking ["FileManager"](https://client.falixnodes.net/server/filemanager?dir=/) or open your SFTP program like FileZilla.

5. Click on the "Mods" folder (if this doesn't show up, then take a look at our versions guide).

6. Press "upload file" and select the Mods you want to upload.

7. Wait for the Mods to upload and (re)start your server.
